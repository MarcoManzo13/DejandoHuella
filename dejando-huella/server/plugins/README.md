What Goes in the Plugins Folder?

The plugins folder is used for scripts that modify the behavior of your Nuxt application at a global level. For example, if you need to initialize an external library, inject global functions or constants, or register global components, you would do that here. With Nitro, plugins can also be used for server-side functionalities, such as connecting to databases when the application starts.
